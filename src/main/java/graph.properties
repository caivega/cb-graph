# There are two possibilities to retrieve all vertices or edges via Couchbase
# 1. Use Views : Views are used in order to retrieve all edges and vertices.
# This means that CB asynchrounously updates an index / view in the background.
#
# 2. Use Lookup objects: 2 lookup objects are used to retrieve a list of all vertices and edges
# This means that we update a lookup object for every add / delete operation
# So the possible values for this setting are 'view' or 'lookup'

# 3. n1ql: Couchbase's query language simplifies the querying, but is not yet general available.
